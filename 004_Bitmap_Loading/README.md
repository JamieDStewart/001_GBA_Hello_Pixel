This program continues the exploration of creating games for the Game boy Advance, this specific tutorial looks at loading bitmap image data into VRAM and displaying it on the screen. This tutorial demonstrates the different pixel modes for the different rendering modes, finally using different rendering modes than the previous tutorials which were limited to mode 3 rendering only.

Primarily the blog post demonstrates how to create the C source file data from a provided image and how to read this image data in code.
